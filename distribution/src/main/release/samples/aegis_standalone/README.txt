Aegis Demo
====================

This demo shows how you can use Aegis with no web service at all
as a mapping between XML and Java.

Prerequisite
------------

If your environment already includes cxf-manifest.jar on the
CLASSPATH, and the JDK and ant bin directories on the PATH
it is not necessary to set the environment as described in
the samples directory README.  If your environment is not
properly configured, or if you are planning on using wsdl2java,
javac, and java to build and run the demos, you must set the
environment.


Building and running the demo using Ant
---------------------------------------

From the base directory of this sample (i.e., where this README file is
located), the Ant build.xml file can be used to build and run the demo. 

Using either UNIX or Windows:

  ant
    

To remove the .class files, run "ant clean"

Building and running the demo using Maven
---------------------------------------

From the base directory of this sample (i.e., where this README file is
located), the pom.xml file is used to build and run the demo. 

Using either UNIX or Windows:

  mvn install   (builds the demo)
  mvn -Prun  (from one command line window)


To remove the generated code, run "mvn clean".
